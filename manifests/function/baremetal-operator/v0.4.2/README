Upstream baremetal-operator doesn't have a release tag for capm3-v0.4.2.
The capm3 v0.4.2 manifests references the master of baremetal operaotr repo
whihc has alrady moved forward to support capm3 0.5.0.

The v0.4.2 "upstream" folder in Airship repo contains the upstream manifests
from the following commit id:

git checkout 99fc4aeb
HEAD is now at 99fc4aeb Point ironic-inspector to the ironic image in quay

This is about the time when capm3 v0.4.2 was released and the last commit
is required as it replaced the newly deprecated ironic inspector image with
the ironic image.
